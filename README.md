### The Why
This proposed website aims to provide an overview of concepts important to promoting diversity and inclusion in education and workplaces. The platform will help users easily gain an overview of the Key concepts of diversity, read tips on practical implimentation and easily find external resources to learn further information. The website's primary goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic and help users find reliable information.

## Design-Brief
A visually appealing, easy-to-navigate webpage that introduces diversity and inclusion concepts and offers basic guidance on how to implement these practices. The focus is on clear communication through effective use of HTML and CSS, utilising Bootstrap for layout and design.

## Colours

Colours were implemented using CSS variables so that the site can be updated with new colour schemes with ease. The final Colour palette was created using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

All colours were reviewed for aesthetic appeal and high contrast, allowing easily readible text. 

![Coolors palette showing DUP colour scheme](/docs/Diverse%20Universe%20Project.png)

## Fonts 

Fonts used were Rubik, Space Mono, and Silkscreen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

The fonts were chosen to give the site an interesting, thematically consistent, overall look. The fonts were implemented using CSS variables, allowing for easy future updates and changes. Primary font was chosen for easy readibility. Secondary font was chosen to compliment main font and provide distinct styling to headings. 
The "brand font" was chosen to suggest a space theme and make the Diverse Universe Project name pop visually and compliment the logo and favicon.

## Logo 

Initial logo was generated using copilot. It was resized and used as a placeholder for initial deployment.

Initial Logo:
![First logo](/assets/images/logosmall.png)

After feedback, the logo was then altered manually in Firealpaca to create a transparent background, make the colours match the chosen colour scheme and be able to adjust size for different screen sizes in a smooth way. 

Deployed Logo:

With more time, a bespoke, transparent logo could be created. 

## Technologies

### Languages used:

- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [MARKDOWN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

### Other tech used:

- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)

Bootstrap was implimented and then removed early on in the project. It was then re-introduced in a limited capacity to enable the easy implimentation of togglible sections to hide and reveal information sections, in additon to a carousel of slides with captions. The default styles were overwritten using custom CSS to ensure a consistent style throughout. 

Copilot was tested for generating HTML and CSS but was utimatly rejected as manual code editing was found to be more efficient. 
The technology has future potential in adding additional pages quickly. This will require futher testing and research that is outside the scope of the current project timeframe.

## testing

For testing multiple resources were used:

1. [Chrome Dev Tools - Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
2. [W3 Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
3. [W3 CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

HTML was tested and some initial errors were discovered and corrected.
![screenshot of errors](/docs/HTML-errors01.png)

All errors with HTML were addressed.
![sreenshot of after errors fixed](/docs/all-better01.png)

CSS was tested and no errors were found. There were 442 warnings, mainly due to external stylesheets being used and the use of variables. 

Lighthouse testing found significant room for improvement. Accessibility was a particular point of potential improvement.

![Screenshot of initial Lighthouse report](/docs/lighthouse01.png)

Aria labels and roles were added to bootstrap buttons in hopes of providing better accessibility. Subsequent testing showed 100% accessibility. 

![Screenshot of second Lighthouse report](/docs/lighthouse02.png)

Lighthouse suggested that improvements could be made regarding performance, this is a potential future improvement.

## Known bugs

Social links to not respond to hover on mobile layout. This may be because you can't hover on stuff on a mobile. Futher research needed.

## Future-Scope

In future updates, more content could be added including more links to the Resources page. 

A media query could be added to the Resources page, giving a more appealing layout on large screens. 

Navbar links could have hover effects added. I would do it now but I don't want to break anything. 


## Credits  

The initial logo, welcome text, key concept definitions, and inclusivity tips were generated with Copilot.
